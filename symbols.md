# OtterSpeak: Symbols Cipher 🦦🔐

Welcome to **OtterSpeak's Symbols Cipher**! This encryption system transforms symbols into a secret, custom-coded language. It's a fun way to encode your special characters and make them unreadable to anyone who doesn't know the key.

## 🔑 The Cipher Map
Each symbol is replaced with a specific symbol according to the following mapping:

- ! → %  
- " → @
```
- # → =
```  
- $ → +  
- % → ?  
- & → /  
- ' → ~  
- ( → [  
- ) → ]  
- * → {  
- + → }  
- , → ^  
- - → _  
- . → :  
- / → ;  
- : → <  
- ; → >  
- < → !  
- = → |  
- > → "  
- ? → #  
- @ → $  
- [ → &  
- \ → '  
- ] → (  
- ^ → )  
- _ → *  
- ` → ,  
- { → -  
- | → .  
- } → /  
- ~ → `  

## 🚀 How It Works
This cipher works by replacing each symbol in your message with its corresponding symbol from the map above. It's perfect for encoding special characters and keeping them hidden.

## ✨ Example
Take the symbol string **"!@#$"**:
- ! → %
- @ → $
```
- # → =
```
- $ → +

So, **"!@#$"** becomes **"%$=+"** in OtterSpeak.

### 💡 Fun Ideas:
- Use this cipher to encode punctuation and special characters.
- Create secret messages using only symbols.
- Challenge others to decode your symbol-based codes!
