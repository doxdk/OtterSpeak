# OtterSpeak: Secure Encryption Library 🦦🔐

Welcome to **OtterSpeak**, a cutting-edge encryption library designed to provide a high level of security for your code and messages. This library transforms your text into a secret, custom-coded language, making it nearly impossible for anyone without the decryption key to access your original data.

Whether you're looking to secure your files or simply explore a unique encryption system, OtterSpeak offers a variety of encryption methods that cover different types of characters, including lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special symbols.

## 🔒 Features
- **High-Security Encryption**: Each file is encrypted with a custom cipher that is not easily reversible without the correct decryption method.
- **Multiple Cipher Categories**: Encrypt your messages using different categories, each with its own unique mapping.
- **Future-proof**: Designed to be part of a larger encryption system for securing files and code in future applications.

## 📚 Available Ciphers
OtterSpeak provides four different cipher categories, each designed to encrypt a specific type of character. Choose the category that suits your needs:

1. **[Lowercase Cipher](https://github.com/doxdk/OtterSpeak/blob/main/lowercase.md)**: A custom mapping for lowercase letters.
2. **[Uppercase Cipher](https://github.com/doxdk/OtterSpeak/blob/main/uppercase.md)**: A custom mapping for uppercase letters.
3. **[Numbers Cipher](https://github.com/doxdk/OtterSpeak/blob/main/numbers.md)**: A custom mapping for numbers.
4. **[Symbols Cipher](https://github.com/doxdk/OtterSpeak/blob/main/symbols.md)**: A custom mapping for special symbols.

Each cipher uses a unique mapping to encode the characters in your text, ensuring that even if someone gains access to your encrypted file, they will not be able to easily decrypt it without the correct key.

## 🚀 How It Works
Each of the cipher categories above transforms the characters in your text into a secret code based on the specific cipher rules. When you apply the cipher, your text becomes unreadable to anyone who doesn't know the corresponding decryption method.

1. Choose the cipher based on the type of data you wish to encrypt (e.g., lowercase letters, symbols, numbers).
2. Use the provided mapping to encode your text or data.
3. To decrypt, simply reverse the process using the inverse mapping.

## 💡 Why OtterSpeak?
- **Highly Secure**: The custom encryption methods make it incredibly difficult to decrypt without the proper key.
- **Versatile**: You can mix and match different ciphers depending on the type of data you're encrypting.
- **Future Integration**: This library is part of a larger vision to create a fully secure encryption system for files and source code.
