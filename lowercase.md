# OtterSpeak: Lowercase Cipher 🦦🔐

Welcome to **OtterSpeak's Lowercase Cipher**! This unique encoding system transforms the letters of the alphabet into a secret, custom-coded language. Whether you're looking to encrypt your messages or simply explore a fun new cipher, this is the place for you.

## 🔑 The Cipher Map
Each letter in the alphabet is replaced with a specific letter according to the following mapping:

- a → x  
- b → f  
- c → t  
- d → z  
- e → q  
- f → h  
- g → y  
- h → o  
- i → p  
- j → k  
- k → w  
- l → m  
- m → r  
- n → c  
- ñ → v  
- o → d  
- p → s  
- q → j  
- r → g  
- s → u  
- t → b  
- u → e  
- v → l  
- w → n  
- x → a  
- y → i  
- z → y  

## 🚀 How It Works
This cipher works by replacing each letter in your message with its corresponding letter from the map above. It's simple yet fun and makes your messages unreadable to anyone who doesn't know the key!

## ✨ Example
Take the word **"hola"**:
- h → o
- o → d
- l → m
- a → x

So, **"hola"** becomes **"odmx"** in OtterSpeak.
