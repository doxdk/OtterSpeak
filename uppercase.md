# OtterSpeak: Uppercase Cipher 🦦🔐

Welcome to **OtterSpeak's Uppercase Cipher**! This encryption system allows you to transform uppercase letters into a secret, custom-coded language. It's a fun way to keep your messages hidden from prying eyes.

## 🔑 The Cipher Map
Each uppercase letter is replaced with a specific letter according to the following mapping:

- A → V  
- B → P  
- C → Q  
- D → M  
- E → Z  
- F → Y  
- G → O  
- H → S  
- I → W  
- J → U  
- K → J  
- L → C  
- M → D  
- N → T  
- Ñ → X  
- O → R  
- P → K  
- Q → L  
- R → A  
- S → H  
- T → F  
- U → G  
- V → B  
- W → N  
- X → E  
- Y → I  
- Z → Ñ  

## 🚀 How It Works
This cipher works by replacing each uppercase letter in your message with its corresponding letter from the map above. It's perfect for creating secret codes or just for fun!

## ✨ Example
Take the word **"HOLA"**:
- H → S
- O → R
- L → C
- A → V

So, **"HOLA"** becomes **"SRCV"** in OtterSpeak.
