# OtterSpeak: Numbers Cipher 🦦🔐

Welcome to **OtterSpeak's Numbers Cipher**! This encryption system transforms numbers into a secret, custom-coded language. It's a fun and creative way to encode numeric data!

## 🔑 The Cipher Map
Each number is replaced with a specific number according to the following mapping:

- 0 → 7  
- 1 → 4  
- 2 → 9  
- 3 → 1  
- 4 → 8  
- 5 → 3  
- 6 → 0  
- 7 → 2  
- 8 → 6  
- 9 → 5  

## 🚀 How It Works
This cipher works by replacing each digit in your number with its corresponding digit from the map above. It's perfect for transforming numeric data into something secret and unreadable to others!

## ✨ Example
Take the number **"12345"**:
- 1 → 4
- 2 → 9
- 3 → 1
- 4 → 8
- 5 → 3

So, **"12345"** becomes **"49183"** in OtterSpeak.
